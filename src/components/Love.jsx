        I am really very sorry for what I am doing and what I did since some days...

      I really don't know what is going on and never knew this would be an outcome. I was wondering whether am I a good child or not. Sometimes it really becomes a harsh thing for me to think about this. Since I know that I am a grown up kid all of my surroundings suggest me to do something and find some source of income and if it lags due to certain reasons than a feeling of being a loser wander around me. Once I really thought that since my dad matches vibes with everyone than why can't with me. Am I really a loser? My grandparents left me for no reason fears me getting distant from my parents too. I too felt it when I've seen my dad enjoying with my elders, brothers and friends. It questioned inner me that what is additional in others rather than me. My dad is been a great companion for others and vice-versa. He could match vibe with me too. But somehow I lagged a lot I don't know why. I coul;d share everything about my life with my dad but some things remained untold just because I never wanted my dad to be in stress. He carries a lot of stress like of the family, society, professional culture and many more, in such scenarious how I could share my life with my dad. Wouldn't it be more stressful for my dad? I recently misbehaved with my parents and I am very guilty about that and I tried to clear all the concise. I apologized and I also show the love towards them but it didn't work. There were many thoughts running in my mind even I was not sure about what to do in such situation. I thought they were breaking bond with me since I am a grown up child and they might need some personal space. Is this necessary? It hurts me a lot. We are a small family and do we actually need personal space from each other? I don't think so. Everything might be solved and all the concise must be get cleared when we talk to each other. Mom and Dad both stopped speaking with me and it hurts me more. It broke me and I couldn't ate as well as drank a drop of water before sometime. There are many things I want to share. I would love to share. But it can happen when we talk.
